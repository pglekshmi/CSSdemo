        <li>Adventures of Tintin</li><p class="b"><img src="./Tintin.jpeg" >Adventures of Tintin (French: Les Aventures de Tintin; [lez‿avɑ̃tyʁ də tɛ̃tɛ̃]) is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, 
            who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular
             European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé's birth in 1907,
              Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies, and had been adapted for 
              radio, television, theatre, and film.</p>
        <li>Beauty & The Beast</li><p class="b"><img src="./beast.jpeg">"Beauty and the Beast" (French: La Belle et la Bête) is a fairy tale written by French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and 
            published in 1740 in La Jeune Américaine et les contes marins (The Young American and Marine Tales).Her lengthy version was abridged, rewritten, and published by French novelist
             Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in Magasin des enfants (Children's Collection) to produce the version most commonly retold. Later, Andrew Lang retold the story in Blue Fairy Book, 
             a part of the Fairy Book series, in 1889. The fairy tale was influenced by the story of Petrus Gonsalvus  as well as Ancient Greek stories such as "Cupid and Psyche" from The Golden Ass,
              written by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis in the second century AD, and "The Pig King", an Italian fairytale published by
             Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola around 1550.</p>
        <li>The Alchemist</li><p class="b"><img src="./alchemist.jpeg"> Alchemist (Portuguese: O Alquimista) is a novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho which was first published in 1988.

            It was composed in the last years of her life, during which she was bedridden and seriously ill.
            The novel became an immediate best-seller, with Sewell dying just five months after its publication, 
            but having lived long enough to see her only novel become a success. With fifty million copies sold, 
            Black Beauty is one of the best-selling books of all time.</p>
